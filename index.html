    <p> In today's world wth increasing populaton the resources that are necessary to meet the needs this growing populaton is also increasing. The resources in the form 
        of industres, agrcultural lands, roadways constructon etc. And this are the basic things that humankind needs for surviving in this century. Our day starts and ends 
        with dustral products. From a toothpaste to night creams we are somehow surrounded by ths products. And so  the case of agrcultural lands. We rely on agrcultural 
        products to feed ourselves. And same go wth constructon of roadways to increase the communicaton. But we also need to think about there impacts on environmrent as well.
        Are we movg forwards towards degradg our envronment? Envronment whch helps us to susta our lfe on these planet. Here we will mainly focus on industral part. We 
        will see once about there negative approach. we wll dscussd regarding those problems in points.
